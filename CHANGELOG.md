- Integration of `dist-s1-enumerator` to identify/localize the inputs from MGRS tile ID, post-date, and track number
- Notebooks and examples to run end-to-end workflows as well as Science Application Software (SAS) workflows
- Docker image with nvidia compatibility (fixes the cuda version at 11.8)
- Using the water mask.
- Extensive instructions in the README for various use-case scenarios.
- Golden dataset test for SAS workflow
- Allow user to specify bucket/prefix for S3 upload - makes library compatible with Hyp3.
- Ensure Earthdata credentials are provided in ~/.netrc and allow for them to be passed as suitable evnironment variables.

## [0.0.2]

### Added

- Pypi delivery workflow
- Entrypoint for CLI to localize data via internet (the SAS workflow is assumed not to have internet access)
- Data models for output data and product naming conventions
- Ensures output products follow the product and the tif layers follow the expected naming conventions
  - Provides testing/validation of the structure (via tmp directories)

### Changed

- CLI entrypoints now utilize `dist-s1 run_sas` and `dist-s1 run` rathern than just `dist-s1`. 
  - The `dist-s1 run_sas` is the primary entrypoint for Science Application Software (SAS) for SDS operations. 
  - The `dist-s1 run` is the simplified entrypoint for external users, allowing for the localization of data from publicly available data sources.

## [0.0.1]
